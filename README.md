# Walmart Statistical Analysis

In my completed Master's program capstone project in Data Science, I performed a statistical analysis on a Walmart retail dataset and developed recommendations for Walmart on how to enhance and optimize its future revenue through effective business strategies.

To conduct my analysis, I utilized four key analytical techniques: descriptive, associational, exploratory data, and predictive analysis. These methods proved highly effective in identifying areas for potential improvement within Walmart and in predicting future revenue using various machine learning models.

# Analytical techniques description below:

Descriptive statistical analysis involves generating summary statistics of a dataset. This includes two main components: measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Measures of central tendency provide an overview of the dataset, including its mean, mode, median, and any outliers. Measures of dispersion, on the other hand, describe the distribution of the dataset and include statistics such as the standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, variance, range, percentiles, quartiles, skewness, and kurtosis.

Associational statistical analysis is used to identify relationships within a dataset. There are four primary types of relationships that can be identified: strong positive, weak positive, strong negative, or weak negative. These relationships are measured using correlation coefficients, which range from -1 to +1. A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a strong positive relationship, whereas a coefficient of -1 indicates a strong negative relationship. A coefficient of 0 indicates no relationship between the variables, while coefficients between 0 and +/- 1 indicate weak relationships.

Exploratory data analysis plays a critical role in identifying patterns and trends within a dataset, and correlation is a fundamental tool for determining the strength and direction of relationships between variables. Correlation matrices are often used to visualize these relationships. Another important component of exploratory data analysis is statistical testing, which can provide valuable insights into the data and support informed business decisions by accepting or rejecting null hypotheses related to the variables. 

Multicollinearity is a concept that arises when independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. The variance inflation factor is a measure of multicollinearity in a regression model. Confidence intervals are another important statistical concept, representing a range of values that likely contain the true population parameter with a specified level of confidence. The confidence level is determined by the sample data and indicates the likelihood of the true values lying within the interval.

The purpose of predictive analysis is to predict future events based on historical data. In this section, 7 machine-learning techniques will be conducted to predict the outcome of our data. The first part of predictive analysis is time series analysis including the Arima model, and Holtz- Winters models. The ARIMA model is a model that measures events that happen over time while Holt-winters is a model that predicts the behavior of a time series. The second part of predictive analysis is regression models including linear, multilinear, logistic, XGboost regressor, random forest regressor, and decision tree regressor.

Predictive analysis involves using historical data to forecast future events. In this section of the analysis, a variety of machine learning techniques will be applied to predict the outcomes of the data.

The first part of predictive analysis focuses on time series analysis, which includes the use of the ARIMA and Holt-Winters models. The ARIMA model is particularly useful in measuring events that occur over time, while Holt-Winters is a model that predicts the behavior of a time series.

The second part of predictive analysis involves the use of regression models. Linear regression models are used to establish relationships between dependent and independent variables, while multilinear regression models are used when multiple independent variables are involved. Logistic regression models are used when the dependent variable is binary, while XGBoost, random forest, and decision tree regressors are all popular machine learning techniques used to analyze complex datasets and establish predictive relationships between variables.

# Conclusion
This report analyzed the Walmart dataset using several analytical techniques. Descriptive analysis was used to provide basic statistics of the dataset, which showed that all variables had non-normal distributions and were statistically different across different groups. Associational analysis determined that temperature and fuel price have positive relationships with weekly sales, while CPI, unemployment, and volume have weak negative relationships. Exploratory data analysis found no significant insights from the correlation matrix but showed that all variables are slightly correlated and have confidence intervals indicating the impact of temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment on weekly sales.

In predictive analysis, six regression models and two time series models were created to predict future sales. Multilinear regression and decision tree regressor were the best models, while linear regression and random forest regressor were the worst models. XGBoost failed to fit the model, and the exact reason is unknown, but it is likely that the data lacked important features. Overall, this report provides valuable insights into the Walmart dataset and highlights the importance of using various analytical techniques to fully understand and predict future outcomes.

# Recommendations
To improve Walmart's sales, several business strategies are recommended. These include improving the in-store experience, increasing product diversity, implementing price optimization, enhancing online presence, optimizing supply chain management, personalized marketing, and enhancing customer service. Price optimization and personalized marketing are effective in attracting customers, while enhancing customer service can improve customer satisfaction. Improving the in-store experience and online presence can make shopping more convenient for customers. Increasing product diversity can also attract customers, but should consider product selection and pricing. Optimizing supply chain management can improve efficiency and reduce costs. Implementing these strategies can lead to increased sales and profitability for Walmart.
